### Week 05 

This week will focus on the methods and analyses of [Jetz et al. 2012 The global diversity of birds in space and time. *Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7424/full/nature11631.html). We will discuss the paper in detail, including how the tree was estimated, MEDUSA and the AIC, and lineage through time plots. We will also go through a tutorial on LTT plots in R.

The tutorial is written in R-Markdown and the rendered HTML can be found here: [http://phyloworks.org/courses/exercises/W5-LTT-Plots.html](http://phyloworks.org/courses/exercises/W5-LTT-Plots.html)
