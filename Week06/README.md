### Week 06 

#### Erica & Jermaine

This week will focus on the methods and analyses of Jønsson et al. 2012 [Ecological and evolutionary determinants for the adaptive radiation of the Madagascan vangas](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/17/6620.short). _PNAS_ 109:6620–6625. We will discuss the paper in detail, including how the tree was estimated and the diversification analyses performed. These analyses include the $\gamma$-statistic of [Pybus and Harvey (2000)](http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/Evolve/Oliver_Pybus_files/TestingMacroevolutionaryModels.pdf) and analyses based on topological tree shape.
