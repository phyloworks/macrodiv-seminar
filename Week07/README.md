### Week 07 

#### Bryan & Nick

This week will focus on the methods and analyses of Moreau and Bell 2013. [Testing the museum versus cradle tropical biological diversity hypothesis: phylogeny, diversification, and ancestral biogeographic range evolution of the ants](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12105/abstract?). _Evolution_ 67:2240â€“2257. We will discuss the paper in detail, including how the tree was estimated and the diversification analyses performed. 

We also discussed the limitations of the methods used in this paper, particularly in light of the simulation study conducted by [May & Moore (2014)](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/15/011452).
