### Week 02 

This week will focus on methods for estimating time-calibrated phylogenies. Trees with branch lengths proportional to time are needed for most methods that seek to evaluate lineage diversification. 

The lecture will focus on Bayesian approaches to estimating divergence times. Thus, the lecture will start by going over some basics of Bayesian statistical inference.
