# EEOB 590B-TH Macroevolution & Lineage Diversification 
### A graduate seminar led by [Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/) at Iowa State University on phylogenetic methods for understanding rates of diversification
### Fridays 3:10 â€“ 5:00 PM in 145 Bessey

## Seminar Description

This seminar course will focus on methods for understanding patterns of biodiversity in the Tree of Life. We will review current phylogenetic approaches for estimating rates of speciation and extinction through some lectures, studying recent papers applying these methods, and mini workshops.

##### Phylogenetic methods for diversification include:
* topological tests of variable rates of diversification
* speciation-extinction models
* methods for detecting shifts in diversification over time
* lineages through time plots
* state-dependent diversification
* understanding the diversification of rapidly evolving infectious diseases

## Software Needed
This seminar will involve some hands-on use of phylogenetic methods for diversification. Please download and install the following programs:

* A good text editor (e.g., TextWrangler, Sublime Text, Notepad++)
* BEAST 2: [http://beast2.org](http://beast2.org/)
* Tracer: [http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)
* FigTree: [http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)
* R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* R Phylogenetics Packages: Install the [Phylogenetics Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html) to get most of the packages for comparative phylogenetics (this can take a while):

```
install.packages("ctv")
library("ctv")
install.views("Phylogenetics")
```

Other helpful tools:

* RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/)
